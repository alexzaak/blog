_Zaak.Dev_ documents the journey of building a fully **self-hosted, privacy-first smart home**. The blog covers topics such as **Home Assistant optimization**, **network design**, **migration from cloud services to local solutions**, and the **implementation of a local voice assistant** powered by on-premise LLMs. Each entry provides practical insights, technical setups, and lessons learned while transitioning from a cloud-dependent smart home to a **secure, efficient, and locally controlled system**.
