## **I. Who am I?**

Hi, I’m **Alex**.  
I work as a **Senior Software Engineer**, currently in the role of **Platform Lead – Android**.  
Outside of work, I’m an enthusiastic photographer, always looking for new ways to capture moments through a creative lens.  
Technology, however, is where my real passion lies — and this blog is where those passions converge.

## **II. Why I’m starting a blog**

This blog is, first and foremost, **a personal documentation** of my journey.  
Think of it as a **diary**, but not in the traditional sense — there won’t be daily updates, but rather **entries whenever there’s progress, insights, or results worth sharing**.

Over time, I want to keep track of every **lesson learned**, every **technical challenge solved**, and the **knowledge I gain** while building a self-hosted, privacy-first smart home environment.


## **III. What this blog is about**

As a child, I was fascinated by how movies and TV shows portrayed intelligent assistants —  
from **J.A.R.V.I.S.** in *Iron Man* to **S.A.R.A.H.** in the TV show *Eureka*.  
Back then, it felt like science fiction.  
Today, technology has advanced to a point where such systems are **within reach for private households**.

It’s already possible to **self-host a large language model (LLM)** on relatively small hardware — even something as compact as a **Mac Mini**.  
This blog is about my journey toward **building my own AI-driven smart home assistant**.  
An assistant that:  

- Can **control every aspect of my home**.  
- Can **listen and respond** naturally to everyone in the house.  
- Can **see and remember context**, improving interactions over time.  
- And yes — one that has **a natural, human-like voice**.  

This is more than automation; this is about creating a **personalized, local AI** that respects privacy while adding real convenience and intelligence to everyday life.

## **IV. That’s my journey**

This blog will evolve **step by step**.  
I’ll document progress whenever I find time — which, as you can imagine, is sometimes limited.  

I’ll also be transparent about the tools I use along the way.  
For example, this very first post was drafted with the help of **ChatGPT** — fitting, considering the topic.

So, buckle up and join me as I explore the path toward a smarter, **fully self-hosted**, AI-powered home.

See you around!
