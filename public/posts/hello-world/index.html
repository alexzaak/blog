<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<br/><br/>
<h2 id="i-who-am-i"><strong>I. Who am I?</strong></h2> <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Alex</strong>.<br>
I work as a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, currently in the role of <strong>Platform Lead – Android</strong>.<br>
Outside of work, I’m an enthusiastic photographer, always looking for new ways to capture moments through a creative lens.<br>
Technology, however, is where my real passion lies — and this blog is where those passions converge.</p>
<h2 id="ii-why-im-starting-a-blog"><strong>II. Why I’m starting a blog</strong></h2> <p>This blog is, first and foremost, <strong>a personal documentation</strong> of my journey.<br>
Think of it as a <strong>diary</strong>, but not in the traditional sense — there won’t be daily updates, but rather <strong>entries whenever there’s progress, insights, or results worth sharing</strong>.</p>
<p>Over time, I want to keep track of every <strong>lesson learned</strong>, every <strong>technical challenge solved</strong>, and the <strong>knowledge I gain</strong> while building a self-hosted, privacy-first smart home environment.</p>
<h2 id="iii-what-this-blog-is-about"><strong>III. What this blog is about</strong></h2> <p>As a child, I was fascinated by how movies and TV shows portrayed intelligent assistants —<br>
from <strong>J.A.R.V.I.S.</strong> in <em>Iron Man</em> to <strong>S.A.R.A.H.</strong> in the TV show <em>Eureka</em>.<br>
Back then, it felt like science fiction.<br>
Today, technology has advanced to a point where such systems are <strong>within reach for private households</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s already possible to <strong>self-host a large language model (LLM)</strong> on relatively small hardware — even something as compact as a <strong>Mac Mini</strong>.<br>
This blog is about my journey toward <strong>building my own AI-driven smart home assistant</strong>.<br>
An assistant that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can <strong>control every aspect of my home</strong>.</li>
<li>Can <strong>listen and respond</strong> naturally to everyone in the house.</li>
<li>Can <strong>see and remember context</strong>, improving interactions over time.</li>
<li>And yes — one that has <strong>a natural, human-like voice</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more than automation; this is about creating a <strong>personalized, local AI</strong> that respects privacy while adding real convenience and intelligence to everyday life.</p>
<h2 id="iv-thats-my-journey"><strong>IV. That’s my journey</strong></h2> <p>This blog will evolve <strong>step by step</strong>.<br>
I’ll document progress whenever I find time — which, as you can imagine, is sometimes limited.</p>
<p>I’ll also be transparent about the tools I use along the way.<br>
For example, this very first post was drafted with the help of <strong>ChatGPT</strong> — fitting, considering the topic.</p>
<p>So, buckle up and join me as I explore the path toward a smarter, <strong>fully self-hosted</strong>, AI-powered home.</p>
<p>See you around!</p>
